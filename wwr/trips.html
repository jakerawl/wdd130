                <p>
                    The first and number one mist popular river trip is down the Dark River. This river is for beginners
                    or anyone that likes a calm trip down the river. The banks of the Dark River offer some truly
                    magnificent foliage and a diverse wildlife population. Form deer to bear you will feel truly
                    immersed in nature. The Dark river offers 3 different stretches of rapids the most intense being a
                    class 2, just enough to splash some water into the boat.

                </figure>
                <p>
                    The Blue River offers a great adventure for those rafters coming for a second time or those that
                    want a little more adventure. Much like the Dark River the blue river offers a variety of sights
                    that truly immerses you in nature. Unlike the Dark River the Blue River has rapids that are a little
                    more intense. The highest rapid class being a class 3. Don't let that scare you away, a lot of
                    people say the Blue River is one of their favorites.

                </figure>
                <p>
                    The full day trip is truly for the most extreme adventurer. It follows the Blue River but instead of
                    getting off halfway through to avoid those big rapids we go right through them! You can expect to be
                    on the river all day riding through some of the most famous and intense rapids. This trip is
                    recommended to those that have experience with rapids or those that truly want a full experience.
