            Bacolod, Philippines
        </h1>
        <p>
            I like Bacolod because it is the capital of the island that I served my mission on. It is full of great people and is known as the city of smiles.
            It sits just off of the ocean and they are currently building a temple just north of the city. Just east of the city sits an active volcano.
